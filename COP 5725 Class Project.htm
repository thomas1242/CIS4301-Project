Overview<br>
</small></h3>

<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="General_Description_and_Expectations"></a>General
Description and Expectations<br>
</small></h4>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>The
class database software project will give you
a real&nbsp;hands-on experience by using
a full-fledged database management system. You will design and
implement a database application, which will include a web-based user
interface as its front-end and a supporting Oracle database&nbsp;as
its
back end. The project includes the following activities spread over the
entire semester:</small></p>
<ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Identify
an application area
for which a DBMS may
prove beneficial to store the data (consider factors such as the need
to store and query large data volumes, support multiple users,
provide concurrent access, maintain consistency, etc.)</small></li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Determine
the
functionalities and operations for the database application. Think
about the various requirements for the user of your
application and the various data attributes that need to be stored and
later queried.</small></li>
  <li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Database
development:</small></li>
  <small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </small>
  <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <small> </small><li><small>Model
the data to be
stored in the database, i.e., identify the various entities,
relationships, constraints, etc.</small></li>
    <small> </small><li><small>Design,
normalize, and
perfect the relational database schema.</small></li>
    <small> </small><li><small>Write
the SQL commands to
create the database.</small></li><li><small>Find appropriate data, and populate the database with at least 100,000 records.</small></li>
    <small> </small>
  </ul>
  <small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </small><li style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>User-Interface
(UI)
development:</small></li>
  <small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </small>
  <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <small> </small><li><small>Design
the web interface
for the application by considering the various "screens" or "flow of
control" for your application. For example, in a photo manager
application you
might start with a user login screen, then a web page to display the
user's photo in a gallery, then another one to display a specific
picture with additional descriptive information, a search page, logout
page, etc. The whole user interface can be considered a directed graph
in which the vertices are the web pages and the edges represent links
(URLs) to other web pages.</small></li>
    <small> </small><li><small>Develop
the web interface
and write supporting code to access the data from your DBMS.</small></li>
    <small> </small>
  </ul>
  <small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </small><li><small>Test
the system and check if
the application works as desired. Your project should "evolve" during
the
course of the semester, but for most part
the functionality promised in the first deliverable must be achieved.
For this purpose, make sure you perform a thorough requirement analysis
in the beginning and balance features so you can "fulfill this
contract" in the end. </small></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>The
end result should be a
functioning application that runs on the&nbsp;web and that uses
your underlying database to enable useful functionality.</small></p>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Project_Goals"></a>Project Goals<br>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>The
class database software project will give you
a real&nbsp;hands-on experience by using
a full-fledged database management system. You will design and
implement a database application, which will include a web-based user

<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a name="Project_Ideas"></a>Project
Ideas</small></h3>
<small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note
that you should select a project that <span style="font-style: italic;">allows
the user to pose
interesting
queries</span>. To store data in the
database only is not enough.
The ideas listed below are some samples. You are free to be creative
and propose your own ideas. Realize that the ideas below are incomplete
descriptions. You need to elaborate them and develop your project more
concretely and in more detail. Do not get intimidated by the examples
that are linked from this web page. These examples are meant to give
you a feel for the application domain. It is up to you to narrowly
define the scope of the application within the time frame of a
semester-long project. Do not forget that you are supposed to have fun!
</span></small><br>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Project_Examples"></a>Project Examples</small></h4>
<ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Coursework
Management
Tool</span>: Develop a system to
store course related information in a university. An example for this
is UF's eLearning or Canvas interface. This system should store data on
users (students, faculty) and coursework (course, semester, year,
student grades, etc.). Users should be able to login and enter and view
grades, manage the course material, perform updates on profile or
grades, import and export data, etc. <br>
    <em>Examples: </em>

    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CourseWork_Course_Management_System" target="_blank">CourseWork@Wikipedia</a><br>
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-style: italic;"> Web
picture albums</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">photo
manager</span>: Develop a web based
system to store, search and display picture galleries for one or more
users. The system should provide the functionality to store user
profiles and pictures, display pictures, search pictures (based on
descriptive attributes), and support the upload and download of
pictures. <br>
    <em>Examples: </em>
    <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa</a>,
    <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" target="_blank">Gallery</a>,
    <a href="http://ajaxphotogallery.com/photo-manager-ajax.html" target="_blank">AjaxPhotoGallery</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Genealogy
database</span>:
Develop a database of information about people, with additional
information such as birth place, education, etc., and construct the
family tree. <br>
    <em>Examples: </em>
    <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/" target="_blank">FamilySearch.org</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ancestory.com/" target="_blank">Ancestory.com</a>,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_software" target="_blank">Genealogy
software@Wikipedia</a> <br>
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Shopping
and eCommerce
application</span>: Develop a
website to help merchants to sell products and for customers to buy
them. The system should provide functionality to store user
information, user roles, product information and a shopping cart.
Additional features possible are ranking and reviews of users and
products, discussion forums, etc. <br>
    <em>Examples: </em>
    <a href="http://www.opencart.com/" target="_blank">OpenCart</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a>,

    <br>
    <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><em>Others:</em>
Of course, there are a whole amount of other ideas such as a movies
database, census database, bank accounts, NBA data, car rentals, auto
insurance, or "map driven" applications such as hurricane database,
realtime location tracker ("spatial-tweets"!), campus map, etc. Let
your imagination run wild! </small></li>

<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Important_Information"></a>Important
Information</small></h3>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Group_Size_and_Formation"></a>Group
Size and Formation</small></h4>
<small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Four&nbsp;students
will&nbsp;form a group. If the total number
of&nbsp;students in class should not be divisible by four, we will
have one or two&nbsp;groups with three students or one group with
five
students. You are free to choose
your
own project members. Further details about the formation process will be
communicated in class and in emails.&nbsp;Each of the steps above
in the general description will be part of a specific project
assignment. You will get detailed
instructions with each assignment. Each group should turn in a common,
single solution to each assignment. Every member of the group will get
the same grade.<br>

</small>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Checkpoints"></a>Checkpoints</small></h4>

<small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">During the
implementation phase, we will have two checkpoints to determine the
progress regarding each group's project implementation. These
checkpoints are a service to the groups and are supposed to avoid that
groups start too late with the implementation in the semester and then
get overwhelmed by the implementation task due to its complexity and
required time involvement. The TAs and the instructor will informally
meet with single groups and have a relaxed conversation about the
group's project implementation. The duration of such a meeting is 15
minutes. All group members have to be present.<br>
<br>
The first checkpoint especially checks whether each group has had a
successful and promising start. The TAs and the instructor will
especially ask the following questions:<br>
</small>
<ol>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Has the
group managed to established the connection between the user interface
and the database for the technologies chosen by the group?<br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Has the
group been able to find real world data sources that fit to and can be
used for the group's project? If not, have "meaningful" data been
generated?</small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have these data already been pre-processed so that they can be bulkloaded into the database?</small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Has the database schema been created in Oracle?</small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have the pre-processed data been bulkloaded into the database according to the database schema?</small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Has the minimum of 100,000 tuples been stored in the database?</small></li>
  <li><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have parts of the user interface been implemented?</small></li>
</ol>
<small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The second
checkpoint especially checks whether each group has made considerable
progress since the first checkpoint and implemented the main parts of
its project. The main questions are:<br>
</small>
<ol>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To which extent has the database part been finalized?</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To which extent have the data been loaded into the database?<br>
    </span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To which extent has the user interface been implemented and is functional?</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To which extent have the needed SQL queries been designed and embedded into the code of the user interface?</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To which extent has the whole software system been tested?<br>
    </span></small></li>
</ol>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Required_Project_Deliverables"></a>Required
Project Deliverables</small></h4>
<ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <small> </small><li><small>Phase
I:&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Requirements
Analysis</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>In
the first phase, your task as an application developer and database
designer is to propose an appropriate project topic, identify its main
data management needs, explore and motivate its potential for
interesting queries, and analyse the needed user functionality. You
should ask yourself questions like<br>
</small>
<ul>
  <small> </small><li><small>What
are the main functions
that the web-based user interface should provide?</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>How
do the different
functions work together?</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>Which
data are needed to
support the functions identified before?</small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>Which
public domain and/or
proprietary software is needed to perform the task? (The database
system used <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be
CISE Oracle.)</small></li>
</ul>
<small>Your first deliverable is
supposed to be a detailed Word document that presents
a clear and structured description and motivation of the selected
project topic and its requirements that you think your software
solution should later fulfil. This means that you have to carefully
deliberate on the requirements and functions and precisely describe
them in your document.<br><br>The
focus of this project is supposed to be on the database part and not so
much on the application part. This means that you should not design and
implement highly sophisticated main memory algorithms but focus on
database queries that evaluate large volumes of stored data. It is
important that you demonstrate in your deliverable that your
application would really benefit from database support and that new
information can be derived from the stored data. A simple retrieval of
data from the database or the connection of different tables is not
sufficient. As an example, let us assume you have some kind of sales
applications and store many sales numbers in your database. Of course,
you can read and display them but this is not very exciting from a
querying standpoint. More interesting queries are:<br></small><ul><li><small>What were the total monthly sales in 2012?</small></li><li><small>Which item was sold most (so that we have to pre-order more of it)?</small></li><li><small>Which item was a slow seller (and should therefore be removed from the inventory since it only wastes storage space)?</small></li><li><small>How many items does the store have in stock?</small></li><li><small>Provide a ranking of the customers based on the amount of money they spent in the store in last three months. </small></li></ul><small>The
answers to all these queries are not directly stored in the sales data.
But they can be derived, that is, computed by database queries.
Therefore, list a number of </small><small>(at least five) </small><small>database queries in your deliverable </small><font size="-1"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">in order to show that your application has the
        potential to have such interesting database queries.</font></font><p><small>Please
note that <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
the first submission of your first deliverable&nbsp;will be graded.
If your first&nbsp;submission should not be satisfactory, a
revision will be requested from you that will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
be considered for (re)grading. This means, the more effort you put into the
first submission, the lower the probability is that a revision is
needed, and the more time you will have for the next deliverable.
Please also note that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
the task of this phase to determine and describe your solutions to the
requirements.</small></p>
</div>
<ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <small> </small><li><small>Phase
II: <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity-Relationship
Diagram Design and User Interface Design</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Based
on the requirements analysis of phase 1, the goal of the second phase
is to describe the overall conceptual design and solution approach of
your project system. This incorporates the two aspects of <span style="font-style: italic;">user interface design</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">conceptual
database design</span>. As for the
user interface design, the task is to devise the set of web pages that
you need to convey the promised functionality of the whole system to
the user at the user interface. You should give a clear description
about the flows of action and web pages the user can expect. It starts
with the entry or welcome web page and spreads out into a number of
successive web pages that are appropriately linked with each other. The
whole web site can be regarded as a graph where the nodes are the web
pages and the edges are the URLs connecting the web pages. As for the
conceptual database design, the task is to leverage the <span style="font-style: italic;">Entity-Relationship</span>
(<span style="font-style: italic;">ER</span>)
Model that we learn in class. You should identify the important entity
sets, relationship sets (cardinalities!), and attributes that are
relevant and have later to be stored in the database in an ER diagram.
Please explain the important concepts of your diagram in detail.<br>
</small>
<p><small>You
should delineate your
concepts carefully and describe them in detail in the second
deliverable that is again a Word document. For drawing the ER diagram,
you may use any suitable tool. Any kind of programming or HTML web page
construction is unnecessary. Drawings by hand, as long as they are
readable, are allowed. Note that the emphasis is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
on producing a high gloss pamphlet with nice pictures. Please give an
overview and introduction of your ideas first before you describe the
user interface design and then the conceptual database design.<br>
</small></p>
<p><small>Please
note that <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
the first submission of your second deliverable will be graded. If your
first&nbsp;submission should not be satisfactory,
a&nbsp;revision
will be requested from you that will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
be considered for grading. This means, the more effort you put into the
first submission, the lower the probability is that a revision is
needed, and the more time you will have for the next
deliverable.&nbsp;Please also note that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
the task of this phase to determine the database schema of your
solution.</small></p>
</div>
<ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <small> </small><li><small>Phase
III: <span style="font-style: italic;">Database
Design</span></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>At
this point, you should be rather clear how your software will look
like, without having done any implementation yet. The clearer and more
detailed you have performed the overall design, the simpler the
implementation will be. The third phase applies a transformation
algorithm presented in class to your ER diagram and results in a relational database
schema. Please express this database schema as a list of SQL <span style="font-style: italic;">create table</span> commands that include integrity constraints and that you can use directly in Oracle. Present the database schema with additional explanations if
they are needed in</small><small> a Word document that represents</small><small> the third deliverable. Please do not forget to include your (perhaps modified) ER diagram at the beginning of the Word document that is the input of the transformation algorithm.<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Please
note that only the&nbsp;first submission of your third deliverable
will be graded. If your first&nbsp;submission should not be
satisfactory, a revision will be requested from you that&nbsp;will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
be considered for grading. This means, the more effort you put into the
first&nbsp;submission, the lower the probability is that a revision
is needed, and the more time you will have for the next deliverable.
Please also note that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
the task of this phase to provide any implementation (part) of your
solution.</small></p>
<ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
  <small> </small>
  <li><small>Phase
IV: <span style="font-style: italic;">Final
project
implementation
and demonstration</span></small></li>

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>At
the demonstration day(s), which will be near the end of the
semester, groups have to present their software system. The instructor
will handle the assignment of time slots to student groups.
Demonstrations will last
30 minutes and will be conducted in the CISE <b>E114</b>
computer labs.</small></div>
<ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</ul>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Due_Dates_of_Project_Deliverables"></a>Due
Dates of Project
Deliverables</small></h4>
<small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">They
will be communicated in class, on the class web page, and/or in
class emails.
</span></small>
<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a name="Details_about_and_Expections_of_the"></a>Details
about and Expections of the Final Project Demonstration&nbsp;</small></h4>
<small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
project demonstration at the end of the semester will be a 30-minute
session between a group, the instructor, and a TA. The atmosphere
during a project demonstration is usually very relaxed and informal.
Please consider the following aspects:<br>
</span></small>
<ol>
  
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Each
project demo lasts 30 minutes. In the first 10 to 15 minutes each group
will provide a presentation of their software system. In the next 10 to
15 minutes the instructor and the TA will ask questions about the
software system. In the last 5 minutes, the instructor and the TA will
determine the groups' project demo grade.</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The group presentation in the first 10 to 15 minutes is held by one or several group members and will provide and explain the <span style="font-style: italic;">highlights</span> of the group's project functionality and implementation.</span></small></li>
  <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <li><small>The following aspects do <i>not</i>
belong to the highlights: (1) input masks and input procedures, (2)
correctness tests for input data, (3) simple search procedures for
data. Especially searching can be performed by very simple SQL queries
and are therefore not so much of interest.<br>
</small></li>
    <li><small>The following aspects belong to the highlights: (1) Interesting 
functionality at the user interface that allows the user to analyze the 
data and leads to new conclusions of and insight into the data stored in
 the database. This aspect has been discussed many times. (2) Complex 
search procedures for data that lead to interesting conclusions of and 
insight into the data stored in the database. (3) Complex SQL queries 
that implement points (1) and (2). This aspect has been discussed many

the next 10 to 15 minutes, the instructor and the TA will ask questions
to all aspects of the group's software with respect to both its
functionality and its implementation. The group has to answer these
questions immediately. A typical question is: "Show us and explain the
SQL query that does ...".</span><br>

  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the last 5 
minutes, the instructor and the TA will go to another 
room, discuss the quality of the project software, the presentation, and
 the answers, and determine the project demo grade. The grade is not 
negotiable with the group members. Therefore, discussions about the 
grade are not allowed.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Slide presentations are not allowed during the group's presentation. A documentation of the software is not needed.</font></small></li>

Environment</small></h4>
<small><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For
the user interface, you are free to use any high-level web
programming language. Some options are Ruby on Rails (RoR), PHP,
.NET, JSP along with Javascript, Ajax, etc. If you have not designed a
single webpage before, now is the right time to get started. Choose one
of the languages mentioned above and get started on your project early!
Use </span><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity">ODBC</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC">JDBC</a>,
or other
connectivity protocols for making the database
connections between the webpages and the database. Additional
information on how to achieve this
can be found on the </span><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/help/database/oracle">CISE Oracle Database Help</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> web page.
The project database </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">must
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">run
on Oracle (using the </span><em style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">orcl</em><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
instance running on CISE servers). To test queries on the database
before you integrate them into the webpages, use a client such as </span><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/help/database/oracle#sqlplus">SQL*Plus</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
(command line) or </span><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html">Oracle SQL Developer</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
